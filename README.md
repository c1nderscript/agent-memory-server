# ðŸ”® Redis Agent Memory Server

A Redis-powered memory server built for AI agents and applications. It manages both conversational context and long-term memories, offering semantic search, automatic summarization, and flexible APIs through both REST and MCP interfaces.

## Features

- **Working Memory**
  - Session-scoped storage for messages, structured memories, context, and metadata
  - Automatically summarizes conversations when they exceed the window size
  - Client model-aware token limit management (adapts to the context window of the client's LLM)
  - Supports all major OpenAI and Anthropic models
  - Automatic promotion of structured memories to long-term storage

- **Long-Term Memory**
  - Persistent storage for memories across sessions
  - Semantic search to retrieve memories with advanced filtering system
  - Filter by session, namespace, topics, entities, timestamps, and more
  - Supports both exact match and semantic similarity search
  - Automatic topic modeling for stored memories with BERTopic or configured LLM
  - Automatic Entity Recognition using BERT
  - Memory deduplication and compaction

- **Other Features**
  - Namespace support for session and working memory isolation
  - Both a REST interface and MCP server
  - Background task processing for memory indexing and promotion
  - Unified search across working memory and long-term memory

## Authentication

The Redis Agent Memory Server supports OAuth2/JWT Bearer token authentication for secure API access. All API endpoints (except `/health`, `/docs`, and `/openapi.json`) require valid JWT authentication unless disabled for development.

### Features

- **OAuth2/JWT Bearer Token Authentication**: Industry-standard authentication using JWT access tokens
- **JWKS Public Key Validation**: Automatic fetching and caching of public keys for token signature verification
- **Multi-Provider Support**: Compatible with Auth0, AWS Cognito, Okta, Azure AD, and any standard OAuth2 provider
- **Flexible Configuration**: Environment variable-based configuration for different deployment scenarios
- **Development Mode**: `DISABLE_AUTH` setting for local development and testing
- **Role and Scope Support**: Fine-grained access control using JWT claims

### Configuration

Authentication is configured using environment variables:

```bash
# OAuth2 Provider Configuration
OAUTH2_ISSUER_URL=https://your-auth-provider.com
OAUTH2_AUDIENCE=your-api-audience
OAUTH2_JWKS_URL=https://your-auth-provider.com/.well-known/jwks.json  # Optional, auto-derived from issuer
OAUTH2_ALGORITHMS=["RS256"]  # Supported signing algorithms

# Development Mode (DISABLE AUTHENTICATION - USE ONLY FOR DEVELOPMENT)
DISABLE_AUTH=true  # Set to true to bypass all authentication (development only)
```

### Provider Examples

#### Auth0
```bash
OAUTH2_ISSUER_URL=https://your-domain.auth0.com/
OAUTH2_AUDIENCE=https://your-api.com
```

#### AWS Cognito
```bash
OAUTH2_ISSUER_URL=https://cognito-idp.region.amazonaws.com/your-user-pool-id
OAUTH2_AUDIENCE=your-app-client-id
```

#### Okta
```bash
OAUTH2_ISSUER_URL=https://your-domain.okta.com/oauth2/default
OAUTH2_AUDIENCE=api://default
```

#### Azure AD
```bash
OAUTH2_ISSUER_URL=https://login.microsoftonline.com/your-tenant-id/v2.0
OAUTH2_AUDIENCE=your-application-id
```

### Usage Examples

#### With Authentication (Production)
```bash
# Make authenticated API request
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     http://localhost:8000/sessions/

# Python example
import httpx

headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

response = httpx.get("http://localhost:8000/sessions/", headers=headers)
```

#### Development Mode (Local Testing)
```bash
# Set environment variable to disable auth
export DISABLE_AUTH=true

# Now you can make requests without tokens
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     http://localhost:8000/sessions/
```

### Token Requirements

JWT tokens must include:
- **Valid signature**: Verified using JWKS public keys from the issuer
- **Not expired**: `exp` claim must be in the future
- **Valid audience**: `aud` claim must match `OAUTH2_AUDIENCE` (if configured)
- **Valid issuer**: `iss` claim must match `OAUTH2_ISSUER_URL`
- **Subject**: `sub` claim identifying the user/client

### Error Responses

Authentication failures return HTTP 401 with details:

```json
{
  "detail": "Invalid JWT: Token has expired",
  "status_code": 401
}
```

Common error scenarios:
- `Missing authorization header`: No `Authorization: Bearer` header provided
- `Missing bearer token`: Empty or malformed authorization header
- `Invalid token header`: Malformed JWT structure
- `Token has expired`: JWT `exp` claim is in the past
- `Invalid audience`: JWT `aud` claim doesn't match expected audience
- `Unable to find matching public key`: JWKS doesn't contain key for token's `kid`

### Security Best Practices

1. **Never use `DISABLE_AUTH=true` in production**
2. **Use HTTPS in production** to protect tokens in transit
3. **Implement token refresh** in your clients for long-running applications
4. **Monitor token expiration** and handle 401 responses appropriately
5. **Validate tokens server-side** - never trust client-side validation alone
6. **Use appropriate scopes/roles** for fine-grained access control

## MCP Server Interface
Agent Memory Server offers an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server interface powered by FastMCP, providing tool-based memory management for LLMs and agents:

- **set_working_memory**: Set working memory for a session (like PUT /sessions/{id}/memory API). Stores structured memory records and JSON data in working memory with automatic promotion to long-term storage.
- **create_long_term_memories**: Create long-term memories directly, bypassing working memory. Useful for bulk memory creation.
- **search_long_term_memory**: Perform semantic search across long-term memories with advanced filtering options.
- **memory_prompt**: Generate prompts enriched with session context and long-term memories. Essential for retrieving relevant context before answering questions.

## Command Line Interface

The `agent-memory-server` provides a command-line interface (CLI) for managing the server and related tasks. You can access the CLI using the `agent-memory` command (assuming the package is installed in a way that makes the script available in your PATH, e.g., via `pip install ...`).

## Getting Started

### Installation

First, you'll need to download this repository. After you've downloaded it, you can install and run the servers.

This project uses [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for dependency management.

1. Install uv:
  ```bash
  pip install uv
  ```

2. Install the package and required dependencies:
  ```bash
  uv sync
  ```

2. Set up environment variables (see Configuration section)

### Running

The easiest way to start the REST and MCP servers is to use Docker Compose. See the Docker Compose section of this file for more details.

But you can also run these servers via the CLI commands. Here's how you
run the REST API server:
```bash
uv run agent-memory api
```

And the MCP server:
```
uv run agent-memory mcp --mode <stdio|sse>
```

**NOTE:** With uv, prefix the command with `uv`, e.g.: `uv run agent-memory --mode sse`. If you installed from source, you'll probably need to add `--directory` to tell uv where to find the code: `uv run --directory <path/to/checkout> run agent-memory --mode stdio`.

### Docker Compose

To start the API using Docker Compose, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your system.

2. Open a terminal in the project root directory (where the docker-compose.yml file is located).

3. (Optional) Set up your environment variables (such as OPENAI_API_KEY and ANTHROPIC_API_KEY) either in a .env file or by modifying the docker-compose.yml as needed.

4. Build and start the containers by running:
   docker-compose up --build

5. Once the containers are up, the REST API will be available at http://localhost:8000. You can also access the interactive API documentation at http://localhost:8000/docs. The MCP server will be available at http://localhost:9000/sse.

6. To stop the containers, press Ctrl+C in the terminal and then run:
   docker-compose down

## Using the MCP Server with Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.
You can use the MCP server that comes with this project in any application or SDK that supports MCP tools.

### Claude
<img src="claude.png">

For example, with Claude, use the following configuration:
  ```json
  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "redis-memory-server": {
          "command": "uv",
          "args": [
              "--directory",
              "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/REPO/DIRECTORY/agent-memory-server",
              "run",
              "agent-memory",
              "-mcp",
              "--mode",
              "stdio"
          ]
      }
    }
  }
  ```
**NOTE:** On a Mac, this configuration requires that you use `brew install uv` to install uv. Probably any method that makes the `uv`
command globally accessible, so Claude can find it, would work.

### Cursor

<img src="cursor.png">

Cursor's MCP config is similar to Claude's, but it also supports SSE servers, so you can run the server in SSE mode and pass in the URL:

  ```json
  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "redis-memory-server": {
        "url": "http://localhost:9000/sse"
      }
    }
  }
  ```


## Configuration

You can configure the MCP and REST servers and task worker using environment
variables. See the file `config.py` for all the available settings.

The names of the settings map directly to an environment variable, so for
example, you can set the `openai_api_key` setting with the `OPENAI_API_KEY`
environment variable.

## Running the Background Task Worker

The Redis Memory Server uses Docket for background task management. There are two ways to run the worker:

### 1. Using the Docket CLI

After installing the package, you can run the worker using the Docket CLI command:

```bash
docket worker --tasks agent_memory_server.docket_tasks:task_collection --docket memory-server
```

You can customize the concurrency and redelivery timeout:

```bash
docket worker --tasks agent_memory_server.docket_tasks:task_collection --concurrency 5 --redelivery-timeout 60 --docket memory-server
```

**NOTE:** The name passed with `--docket` is effectively the name of a task queue where
the worker will look for work. This name should match the docket name your API server
is using, configured with the `docket_name` setting via environment variable
or directly in `agent_memory_server.config.Settings`.

## Memory Compaction

The memory compaction functionality optimizes storage by merging duplicate and semantically similar memories. This improves retrieval quality and reduces storage costs.

### Running Compaction

Memory compaction is available as a task function in `agent_memory_server.long_term_memory.compact_long_term_memories`. You can trigger it manually
by running the `agent-memory schedule-task` command:

```bash
agent-memory schedule-task "agent_memory_server.long_term_memory.compact_long_term_memories"
```

### Key Features

- **Hash-based Deduplication**: Identifies and merges exact duplicate memories using content hashing
- **Semantic Deduplication**: Finds and merges memories with similar meaning using vector search
- **LLM-powered Merging**: Uses language models to intelligently combine memories

## Running Migrations
When the data model changes, we add a migration in `migrations.py`. You can run
these to make sure your schema is up to date, like so:

```bash
uv run agent-memory migrate-memories
```

## Development

### Running Tests
```bash
uv run pytest
```
